India said that the operation was in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025 in which 26 civilians were killed. India accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Pakistan denied.\\nOn 7 May, India launched Operation Sindoor with missile strikes on terrorism-related infrastructure facilities of Pakistan-based militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, and said that no Pakistani military or civilian facilities were targeted. According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, including mosques, and resulted in civilian casualties. Following these strikes, there were border skirmishes and drone strikes between the two countries. Pakistan's army retaliated on 7 May, by launching a blitz of mortar shells on Jammu, particularly Poonch, killing civilians, and damaging homes and religious sites. This conflict marked the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations.\\nIn the early hours of 10 May, India accused Pakistan of launching missile attacks on Indian air bases including the Sirsa air base while Pakistan accused India of launching attacks on several Pakistan air bases, including Nur Khan, Rafiqi, and Murid. As conflict escalated on 10 May, Pakistan launched its Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, in which it said it had targeted several Indian military bases.\\nAfter the four-day military conflict, both India and Pakistan announced that a ceasefire had been agreed after a hotline communication between their DGMOs (Directors General of Military Operations) on 10 May 2025. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held extensive correspondence with both Indian and Pakistani officials during the negotiations.

The U.S. has the concept of judicial review and the separation of powers, which are fundamental structures. So maybe the table is drawing parallels between the Basic Structure Doctrine in India and similar principles in the U.S.\\n\\nI should explain that while the U.S. doesn\\'t have the \\'Basic Structure\\' Doctrine by name, it has analogous concepts like judicial review and the separation of powers that serve similar functions in preserving the Constitution\\'s framework.\\n\\nI should also mention that the main items in the table likely highlight these comparisons, showing how both systems ensure constitutional integrity but through different legal mechanisms.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don\\'t provide any incorrect information, so I\\'ll clarify that the doctrine isn\\'t part of U.S. law but that similar principles exist there.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe query appears to refer to a table or context related to the United States and the \"Basic Structure Doctrine.\" However, the \"Basic Structure Doctrine\" is not a U.S. legal or constitutional concept. It is actually a legal doctrine that originated in Indian constitutional law, particularly in the case of *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973). This doctrine holds that while the Indian Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution, which includes fundamental principles such as federalism, secularism, and the rule of law.\\n\\nIf the table or context you are referring to is comparing this doctrine to U.S. constitutional law, it might be drawing parallels with the U.S. system of constitutional interpretation. In the U.S., the Supreme Court has the authority of judicial review, which allows it to determine whether laws or government actions are consistent with the U.S. Constitution. While the U.S. does not have a direct equivalent of the \"Basic Structure Doctrine,\" the idea of protecting fundamental constitutional principles is a shared concept in both legal systems.\\n\\nIf you could provide more details or clarify the specific table or context you\\'re referring to, I could give a more precise explanation.'"
